# pz-lua-stubdata

This repository hosts the [Rosetta](https://github.com/asledgehammer/PZ-Rosetta-Schema) data files used to generate typestubs for Project Zomboid's Lua source.

It's currently up to date with 42.12.3, with the exception of some [known gaps](https://github.com/omarkmu/pz-lua-stubdata/issues/2).

For the combined typestubs, including those generated from this data, see [Umbrella](https://github.com/PZ-Umbrella/Umbrella).  
The program used for typestub generation is available at [pz-lua-stubgen](https://github.com/omarkmu/pz-lua-stubgen).
